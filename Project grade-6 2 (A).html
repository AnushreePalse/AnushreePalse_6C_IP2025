<h2 id="title" style="text-align=center"; ><i>What is NavIC And Why Is It So Helpful?</i></h2>

<h2 style="color:green"; ><u>India's Contribution and Development:-</u></h2>
<p><h3>NavIC is an independent system that's built, operated, and controlled by India. It's designed to reduce India's reliance on other countries' satellite systems, especially for strategic needs. NavIC has many applications including <i>Disaster Management, Defense, Agriculture, Transportation, Marine fisheries, and much more</i>.NavIC is a satellite navigation system. NavIC stands for <i>Navigation with Indian Constellation</i>. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) developed NavIC to provide <i>accurate positioning and timing information</i> across India and the surrounding region.</h3></p>

<h2 style="color:orange"; ><u>Navigation:</u></h3>
<p><h3>It consists of 7 satellites orbiting the Earth to provide accurate positioning  and timing information. NavIC has a network of ground stations that operate 24/7 (all day and night), including a <i>control center, precise timing facility, and range monitoring stations</i>. It offers three services: <i>Standard Position Service (SPS)</i> for civilian use, <i>Restricted Service (RS)</i> for authorized users like the defense forces and a <i>Search and Rescue service</i>.</h3></p>

<h2 style="color:orange"; ><u>Disaster Management:</u></h3>
<p><h3>As it provides accurate location data it helps rescue teams navigate difficult land and locate affected people quickly. NavIC can provide <i>real-time data on the movement and intensity af natural disasters like cyclones, floods, and earthquakes</i>. NavIC helps issue timely warnings to communities in the path of natural disasters. It also provides precise location data that is crucial for assessing damage.</h3></p>

<h2 style="color:orange"; ><u>Agriculture:</u></h3>
<p><h3>It helps farmers map and analyze the soil in fields. NavIC helps them to moniter their crops and implement precise planting and harvesting strategies. It also helps farmers reduce waste and operational costs. NavIC helps guide tractors and other agricultural machinery accurately.</h3></p>

<h2 style="color:green"; ><u>Second Generation:-</u></h2>
<p><h3>The second Generation of NavIC satellites includes enhanced features, such as: <i>A developed atomic clock, Improved encryption systems</i> (a method of protecting data by converting into unreadable format can only accessed by authorized parties), <i>Enhanced signal resilience, and The L1 frequency band for civil mobile usage</i>. It is also aiming for expanding the constellation of 7 satellites to 12.</h3></p>
