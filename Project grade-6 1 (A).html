<h2 id="title" style="text-align=center"; ><i>The Amazing Life Of Ila Sachani</i></h2>

<p class="para" style="text-align=center"; ><h3>Even if you enter a small room of a small house in Moti Vavdi village, Bhavnagar, Gujrat, you will find it extremely colorful. There are many wonderful objects like clothes, cushions, pillows, bedcovers, and much more are made using the <i>Kathiawar</i> embroidery. <i>Ila Sachani</i>, a wonderful lady, makes all these things with a shiny needle and extreme skill. She is very good at Kathiawar embroidery, which needs a lot of skill to master.</h3></p>
<br>

<h2 style="color:green"; ><u>Birth And Childhood:-</u></h2>
<p><h3>Ila Sachani's journey began in Amreli, Gujrat, where she was born, on <i>19 December 1895</i>, in a farmers family. Just as she was born she started facing many challenges, as she was born with her hands hanging loose by her side. This meant that she could not do her daily chores like other children could. Ila's mother and grandmother helped her to overcome these challenges. At first they taught her basic things like eating and combing her hair with her feet. Ila's mother and grandmother were skilled in Kathiawar embroidery, which they decided to teach Ila. At first threading a needle was very hard and seemed impossible. But she did not give up and accepted the challenge with determination. She soon became an expert at a young age. She also learnt many other styles, even ones from outside Gujrat- <i>Kachhi, Kashmiri, Lucknawi,</i> and others.</h3></p>
<br>

<h2 style="color:green"; ><u>Popularity:-</u></h2>
<p><h3>At first she crafted her designs only for her family and friends, who were surprised by her talent. Soon people in the village, too, discovered Ila's special skill. This reached the government office in Surat. They were impressed by her work and decided to display samples of her work in a state level exihibition. People observed her beautiful embroidery done by her feet and happily purchased them. Ila was now very famous! Ila was highly encouraged by this and participated in many more exhibitions not only state level but also national level.</h3></p>
<br>

<h2 style="color:green"; ><u>Awards:-</u></h2>
<p><h3>Ila recieved many awards and medals for her artwork and also for her willpower and creativity that the art showed. She had worked immensly hard and proved worthy of the <i>President's Medal</i> that she recieved.</h3></p>
<br>

<p><h3>Ila proved, through her creations, that challenges can be overcome with hard work, positivity and never giving up.<i>Her inspiring story tells us that art has the power to rise above physical boundries.</i></h3></p>
