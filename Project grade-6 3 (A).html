<h2 id="title" style="text-align=center"; ><i>From Zero To Infinity: Srinivasa Ramanujan</i></h2>

<h2 style="color:green"; ><u>Who he was:-</u></h2>
<p><h3>Srinivasa Ramanujan was an indian mathamatician who made many discoveries in the field of mathamatics.He was a self-taught mathamatician and made great contributions to <i>number theory, elliptic functions, continued fractions, and infinite series</i>.</h3></p>

<h2 style="color:green"; ><u>Contributions:-</u></h2>
<h2 style="color:orange"; ><u>Infinite series for pie:</u></h2>
<p><h3>In 1914, Ramanujan found a formula for the <i>infinite series for pie</i>, which forms the basis of many of the algorithms we use today.</h3></p>

<h2 style="color:orange"; ><u>Ramanujan number:</u></h2>
<p><h3>1729, is known as the Ramanujan number as it is the sum of the cubes of two numbers 9 and 10.</h3></p>

<h2 style="color:orange"; ><u>Circle Method:</u></h2>
<p><h3>Ramanujan, along with GH Hardy, invented the circle method which gave the first approximations of the partition of numbers beyond 200. This method contributed to solving complex problems of the 20<sup>th</sup> century such as <i>Waring's conjecture</i> and other additional questions.</h3></p>

<h2 style="color:green"; ><u>Life:-</u></h2>
<p><h3>He was born on <i>22 December 1887, at Erode in present-day Tamil Nadu</i>. Ramanujan expressed a fast grasp on mathematics at a young age. Despite being a mathematic prodigy his career did not begin well. He recieved a collage scholarship in 1904, but quickly lost it due to failing in non-mathematical subjects. It was around this that he began his famous notebooks. He was poor until 1910 when he was interviewed by <i>R. Ramchandra Rao, secratery of the Indian Mathematical Society</i>. He was initially doubtful of Ramanujan but later realised his skilles and supported him financially. He was <i>mentored at Cambridge by GH Hardy</i>, a well known british mathematician who encouraged him to publish his findings in papers. He died on <i>26 April 1920, at Kumbakonam Tamil Nadu</i>.</h3></p>

<h2 style="color:green"; ><u>More to Know:-</u></h2>
<p><h3>Ramanujan's findings are studied by mathematicians even today. They have been recorded in his famous notebooks: <i>three notebooks and a 'Lost Notebook' which has not been published</i>. His birth anniversary <i>22 December is observed as National Mathematics Day</i>.</h3></p>
